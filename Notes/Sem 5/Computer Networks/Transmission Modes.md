## Baseband Transmission
---
- Entire bandwidth of the channel is used to send one signal at a time
- Data is sent as digital signals
- Used in LAN(Ethernet)
- In coaxial or twisted pair cables
- Transmission distance is limited as digital signals decay easily
- simpler and cheaper

>XBaseY -> Ethernet Cable
>- X refers to the speed or bandwidth
>- Base marks the cable as Base band
>- Y refers to the maximum distance in 100 metres

>[!info]
>-	Y can be replaced by 
>	- T => It is Twisted pair cable
>	- FX => It is optical fibre

>[!example]
>10Base5
>- 10Mbps
>- 500 metres

>[!example]
>10GBaseT
>- 10Gbps
>- Twisted pair cable

>[!example]
>10GBaseFX
>- 10Gbps
>- Optical Fibre
## Broadband Transmission
---
- The channel is divided into multiple frequency ranges using Frequency Division Multiplexing(FDM)
- Each frequency band carries a separate analog signal (can carry modulated digital signals also)
- Used in WAN, Cable TV ...
- Multiple signals can travel simultaneously over the same medium
- Longer distance possible due to analog modulation
- More complex and costly

>[!info]
>Device to transform
>- digital data into analog signals => Modem
>- analog data into digital signals => Codec (Coding, Decoding)
