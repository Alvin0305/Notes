#### PORT-Number
- Identifies which process is using the network within a system
- 0 -> 1024 are called **Well defined** as they are used for predefined services
	- HTTP -> 80
	- HTTPS -> 443
	- DNS -> 53
- 1024 -> 65535 are called **ephemeral** since, they are not preassigned and we can use it for our purposes. 
- When a device receives a packet, the port number defines, to which process the packet should be given
#### IP-Address
- Two types
	- Public
		- Known to everyone
		- Globally unique
		- Assigned by ISP
		- Not free
		- Router have a public IP
	- Private
		- Used only in local/private network
		- Unique only inside a local network
		- Assigned by Router
		- Free
		- Not directly accessible from the internet
- Versions of IP
	- IPv4
		- 32 bit: represented as 4 octets -> 192.168.1.1
		- each part can vary from 0 to 255
	- IPv6
		- 128 bit: represented in hexadecimal -> 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334
- Routers acts as a [[Networking Concepts#DHCP Server|DHCP]] servers (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and assigns IP to devices
- Routers acts as a [[Networking Concepts#NAT|NAT]] also translating IPs
- It identifies to which local network (router), the packet should be send. From the IP address, the router can understand to which router the packet should be forwarded.
- Works in Network Layer
#### MAC-Address
- Medium Access Control Address
- 48 bit
- Unique address for each device in the internet
- Hard-coded into the NIC of the device
- Works in Data link Layer
- Used only inside a LAN
- Helps devices communicate inside a LAN
