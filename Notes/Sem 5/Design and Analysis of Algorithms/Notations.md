#### $Z_n$
---
- this is the set of equivalence classes represented by numbers in range 0 to n - 1
- for simplicity, its just 0 -> n - 1
$Z_n = \{[a]_n : a \in {0, ..., n - 1} \}$
$Z_n = \{[0]_n, [1]_n, ..., [n - 1]_n\}$
- this is often written as {0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1}
#### $Z_n^+$
---
- this is the set $Z_n$ excluding 0
$Z_n^+ = \{[1]_n, ..., [n - 1]_n\} = Z_n - \{0\}$
- this is often written as {1, 2, 3, ..., n - 1}
#### $[a]_n$
---
- this is the set of numbers in the equivalence class of a, i.e., numbers whose modulus N will be same as a mod N
$[a]_n = \{b \in Z | b \equiv a mod N \}$
$[2]_5 = \{..., -8, -3, 2, 7, 12, ...\}$
#### $Z_n^*$
---
- this is the set of numbers which are co-prime to n and is less than n
$Z^*_n = \{[a]_n \in Z_n | gcd (a, n) = 1\}$
$Z^*_8 = \{1, 3, 5, 7\} \text{= coprimes of 8 from 1 to 8}$
#### $\pi_n$
---
- this is the number of primes less than or equal to n 
$\pi_n = \text{number of primes} \le n$
